Time Loop Academy:

It’s a day just like any other… 
You wake up and head to school. After meeting up with your friends and taking a test the school day comes to a close. 
Unfortunately, you’re on cleaning duty and need to stay late. 
Afterwards, as you begin to pack your things to leave, you can’t help but feel uneasy walking the halls… Suddenly, you are stricken from behind and killed. 
You awake out of bed with a sudden jerk: “Didn’t I just die?” But when you check the calendar, you see you have gone back in time to that very morning before your death.
